Career Recommendation System for Indian Students


Project Overview

This innovative career recommendation system is designed specifically for students in India. It leverages a dataset of elite LinkedIn profiles to provide personalized guidance, helping students understand and excel in the complex job market. Unlike traditional systems, it uses advanced data processing techniques and machine learning for precise career path prediction.

Key Features


Personalized Career Mapping: Detailed exploration of careers, emphasizing the differences and interrelations between job roles.

Advanced Data Processing: Utilizes Selenium for web scraping, along with ChatGPT API and NLTK for text processing.

Machine Learning Model: Combination of TF-IDF, TruncatedSVD, and XGBClassifier for accurate career predictions.

Innovative Clustering Technique: Custom mechanism to match student profiles with a diverse range of job roles.

Impact and Results


High Accuracy: 95% success rate in career path predictions.

Balanced Metrics: Approximately 90% in precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Multi-dimensional Career Insights: Provides diverse insights into potential career paths.


Application Example:

A student considering a Data Scientist role might discover alignment with other roles like Machine Learning Engineer or Quant Engineer, broadening their career options.
